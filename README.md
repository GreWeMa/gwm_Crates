**GWMCrates** - a plugin for minecraft servers that use Sponge or SpongeForge. With this plugin you are able to add as many crates as you want, and you can configure them as you like.  
You can read the documentation about GWMCrates and its configuration on [the wiki](https://gitlab.com/GreWeMa/gwm_Crates/wikis).

For discussions we have a [forum thread](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/20125) and a [discord server](https://discord.gg/Y94eyaX).

Also, the plugin has an [API for developers](https://gitlab.com/GreWeMa/GWMCrates/wikis/API), which allows you to customize the plugin even more!
